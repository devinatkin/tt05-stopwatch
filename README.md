# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Lab 3 

This project is slightly modified code from the ENEL 453 Lab 3 provided code. It will act as a timer, setting the time, then counting down to zero. When the time hits zero the leds will flash until the output is reset.
